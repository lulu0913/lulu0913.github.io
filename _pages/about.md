<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I have been working at Ant Group as an Algorithm Engineer since 2024.
I graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. Bang Wang in MINS Lab. Prior to this, I also got my bachelor's degree at HUST in 2021. My research interest focuses on Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models.

- VRKG4Rec: Virtual Relational Knowledge Graph for Recommendation [[Paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020025523014196) [[Code]](https://github.com/lulu0913/RAGNN)

  \- This work argues that the relations in knowledge graph exhibit a long-tail distribution, limiting their utility in recommendation systems. Thus, the paper suggests virtual relational knowledge graphs for recommendation tasks.
