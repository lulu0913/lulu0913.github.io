<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year Master's student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), where I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. Bang Wang in MINS Lab. Prior to this, I also got my bachelor's degree at HUST in 2021. My research interest focuses on Data Mining, Graph Neural Networks and Large Language Models.
